      I don't like spam, you don't like spam, no one likes spam. This site won't send you spam -- it'll only send you notifications emails to which you opt in. And every
      email has a link in it to unsubscribe you from that notification.
    </p>
    <p>
      This site uses Google Analytics to help me keep track of usage. If you sign in through Google or Facebook, I ask for the minimum permissions required, and don't
      use any data from them aside from your email address (only to send notifications you request).
    </p>
    <p>
      Aside from that, I do not collect or store any personal information. If you have any questions or concerns about your privacy, contact me at cwilson at mke dot tools.
